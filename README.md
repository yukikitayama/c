# C

CPU
- Central processing unit
- Does most of the computing work
- Instructions are executed here

RAM
- Random access memory
- Stores the data of a program while it's running

Hard drive
- Permanent storage
- Stores files that contain program source code, even while the computer is turned off.

Operating system
- A program that controls the entire operation of a computer
- All input and output
- Manages the computer's resources and handles the execution of programs.

Fetch / Execute cycle
- Life of a CPU
- Fetches an instruction from memory (using **registers**) and executes it (loop)

Higher level programming languages
- Easy to write programs
- Opposite of assembly language
- C is a higher level programming language

Compiler
- A program that translates the high-level language source code into the detailed set of machine language instructions the computer requires
- Generates the tedious instructions to the CPU
- Checks valid syntax of programs, finds errors, and reports them to you
- Doesn't produce an executable until you fix them.
